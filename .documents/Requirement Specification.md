# Requirement Specification



# 1. Current State  
Our team consists of several music enthusiasts that are eager to listen to new music every day, and share our thoughts on it. We like to discuss everything about music - albums, concerts, musicians, record labels, and so on. We've been visiting and using many online forums and blogs, but none of them were able to satisfy our needs, so we have to make a move and create an environment where we can share our opinions without any limitations.

# 2. Scope
The goal of this project is to create a fully functional music blog, where members can post album reviews, concert experiences, interviews and users can view them.  Aside from the main function, this page has to have a user management system, which include registering new users, logging them in and out, changing password and profile details.

-**Home page:** This is the main page of the website. In this page users can see the latest featured blog posts.
-**Review page:** Here users can see posts only about album reviews.
-**Concerts page:** Users can see concert reviews.
-**Interviews page:** Users can see interviews.
-**Register:** On this page users can register an account.
-**Log in:** This is the page where users can log in to their account
-**Profile:** Users can view their profile information, like username, full name, date of birth, email address, and they can change them, including their password.

# 3. Standards & Laws

# 4. Current business model
The team is currently using multiple different websites for music discussions and we started to develop our own audience. Right now, we aren't able to work very well as a team because of not having our own website.
