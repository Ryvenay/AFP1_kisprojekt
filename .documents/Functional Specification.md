# 1. Current State 

We've been commissioned by a team of music enthusiast who've been posting album reviews, concert experiences, and music related content on several sites. Over time they've gained a remarkably large audience and they decided that they'd like to continue their work on their own platform, where their reader base can grow even more. Our task is to develop this platform where they can post their content more efficiently and work together with ease.


# 2. Scope
The goal of this project is to create a fully functional music blog, where members can post album reviews, concert experiences, interviews and users can view them.  Aside from the main function, this page has to have a user management system, which include registering new users, logging them in and out, changing password and profile details.
The project contains the ordinary website elements like, registration, login system, posting etc.

# 3. Standards & Laws

# 4. Current business model
The team is currently using multiple different websites for music discussions and we started to develop our own audience. Right now, we aren't able to work very well as a team because of not having our own website.
