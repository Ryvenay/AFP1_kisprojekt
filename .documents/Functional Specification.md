# 1. Current State 

We've been commissioned by a team of music enthusiast who've been posting album reviews, concert experiences, and music related content on several sites. Over time they've gained a remarkably large audience and they decided that they'd like to continue their work on their own platform, where their reader base can grow even more. Our task is to develop this platform where they can post their content more efficiently and work together with ease.


# 2. Scope
The goal of this project is to create a fully functional music blog, where members can post album reviews, concert experiences, interviews and users can view them.  Aside from the main function, this page has to have a user management system, which include registering new users, logging them in and out, changing password and profile details.
The project contains the ordinary website elements like, registration, login system, posting etc.

# 4. Current business model
The team is currently using multiple different websites for music discussions and we've started to develop our own audience. Right now, we aren't able to work very well as a team because of not having our own website where we can manage the content we share. Furthermore, our content is hard to find for our followers, often times lost in the vast amount of posts being published on these websites. Needless to say that this is far from optimal for us and for our audience.

# 5. Requested Business model
Although the members of our team are creating content purely as a hobby, we'd like to improve on our online presence, and work towards being professionals. This requires a new website for us, where we're able to do a lot more than we can right now. Our vision is the following:

- Functions that allow members to post, edit and delete content.
- Visitors can view the posts, and search through them.
- Easy to use, intuitive interface and navigation.
- Visitors must have an internet connection in order to connect to the website and use it without any disruption.
- Fully functional database with secure connection.
- Visitors don't have to be registered to view the contents shared by our members.

# 6. Request List

-Database with tables and relations which contains:
  - The user's datas
  - The post and which user wrote it
  - The post's comments
  - Latest editing of a post
