Our team consists of several music enthusiasts that are eager to listen to new music every day, and share our thoughts on it. We like to discuss everything about music - albums, concerts, musicians, record labels, and so on. We've been visiting and using many online forums and blogs, but none of them were able to satisfy our needs, so we have to make a move and create an environment where we can share our opinions without any limitations.

# 2. Scope
The goal of this project is to create a fully functional music blog, where members can post album reviews, concert experiences, interviews and users can view them.  Aside from the main function, this page has to have a user management system, which include registering new users, logging them in and out, changing password and profile details.
The project contains the ordinary website elements like, registration, login system, posting etc.

# 3. Standards & Laws

# 4. Current business model
The team is currently using multiple different websites for music discussions and we started to develop our own audience. Right now, we aren't able to work very well as a team because of not having our own website.
